# Cancer type prediction

**Aix Marseille university - Stats3 - Machine Learning Project**


### Introduction
This algorithm has been developed to predict cancer type from real cancer patient gene expression data available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq).
The program is use Neural Network to perform a Multi-Label Classification.

### Requirements
